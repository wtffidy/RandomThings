# 🎲 RandomThings
A collection of self-made (ChatGPT-assisted) Python scripts designed to either automate repetitive Minecraft tasks or help you choose which Skua script to run next.

> **Note:** Be sure to **unzip/extract the files** before using them!

## 🌀 Pick_a_Script
Spin the wheel and let fate decide what Skua script to run.

### How to Use:
1. **Unzip** the folder.
2. Run `Spinner.py`.
3. Wait ~1 minute for it to load ~1700 scripts into the wheel.  
   _(Yeah, it looks messy — sorry 😆)_
4. Press `Space` to spin the wheel.
5. The selected result appears at the bottom of the window.

## 🛠️ Minecraft Macros
Useful macros I used while playing various Minecraft modpacks.

### Controls:
- Most macros toggle **on/off** with `F6`.
- `SpamShift.py` toggles with **Right-Tab**.
